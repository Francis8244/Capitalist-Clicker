Game similar to adventure capitalist where you have you start off with a menial job of selling lemonade and have to manually click a button to earn money, then with that money, you can buy a worker that does the job for you automatically. Once you earn enough money through the manual labor of clicking the button along with the passive income from the worker, you can unlock a better job, then repeat this process until you obtain 1 billion dollars. Made with JavaFX for the front-end and Java for the backend. Here is a picture of the game:
